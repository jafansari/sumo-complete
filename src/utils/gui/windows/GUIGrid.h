/**
 * @class GUIGrid
 * This class lays a grid over a network in order to allow the drawing of
 *  only a part of the network: the viewport of a view on the simulation is
 *  used to determine the streets, junctions, vehicles etc. actually
 *  visible (not outside the viewport). The information about which streets
 *  are visible are copied into a container which should be supplied by the
 *  view that wants to know which parts shall be visualised.
 * It is obvious, that the view should call this method only if the viewport
 *  has been changed.
 * The grid itself is made of cells. Each cell holds a small part of the area
 *  and the number of cells to use horizontally and vertically may be specified
 *  (although no tests have been done and the value 10 is used for both
 *  directions). Each cell contains a set of items which do lie within the cell
 *  and each item is represented as a bit. This allows to store the values in
 *  a memory saving way and allow a fast access, though.
