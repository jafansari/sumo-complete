 * This class is responsible for vehicle building and deletion. It stores

 *
 * This class also realizes the tripinfos and the vehroutes - outputs, both
 *  generated when a vehicle is removed from the simulation, see 
 *  scheduleVehicleRemoval.
 *
 * Use this class for the pure microsim and GUIVehicleControl within the gui.
