This script is based on the script from David Eppstein, UC Irvine.
This script is to find the shortest path from the given origin 'start' to the other nodes in the investigated network. 
The Dijkstra algorithm is used for searching the respective shortest paths. 
the link information about the shortest paths and the corresponding travel times   
will be stored in the lists P and D respectively.
