traceExporter2
==============
(I) decription:
traceExporter2 converts sumo trace files for use in ns2. Three files are 
generated:
(1) activityfile: holds time intervals at which every used vehicle 
occures
(2) mobilityfile: holds movement data for every used vehicle
(3) configfile: holds statical information about the simulation

(II) requirements:
To use this program you need java 5 or newer, traceExporter2.jar and 
the 
libs directory. traceExporter2.jar and the libs directory have to be in 
the same location.

(III) usage:
java -jar traceExporter2.jar ns2 -n net.xml -t netstate.xml -a 
activity.tcl -m mobility.tcl -c config.tcl -b [BEGIN] -e [END]

* xml-files are sumo-specific input files
* tcl-file are ns2-specific output files
* [BEGIN], [END] form the interval for which sumo-data will be exported 
to ns2
