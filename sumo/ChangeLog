debugging


Changes from 0.8.2.1 to 0.8.2.2
- User-relevant changes:
 - Simulation
  - XML-Trigger bug on using speed triggers removed
  - emission of vehicles on multi-lane source edges debugged (now all lanes are used)
  - Debugged the problem of vehicles stopping before the route is over (reported by Jonathan Davies)
  - setting tls-offsets debugged
 - Netconvert
  - Computation of left-movers debugged

Changes from 0.8.0.2 to 0.8.2.1
Please remind that several option names have changed! The most important: "net-files" (router, simulation) is now "net-file"...
Check user documentation and man-pages for this.

  - POlygon visualisation added
  - Breakpoints added
  - Setting and Saving of additional net weights added (preliminary, subject to improve)

  - --edges-min-speed <SPEED_MS> allows to remove all edges from the input on which a lower speed than <SPEED_MS> is allowed
  - --elmar allows to import NavTech-GDF-files parsed using Elmar Brockfelds parser
  - --tiger allows to import tiger files (preliminary, does not look THAAAAT good for an unknown reason, yet)
 - Router
  - Generation of random route after the first depart fixed
  - Warnings about missing weights are printed only once per edge
  - Supplementary Weights
  - Examples have now a new folder structure
- Developer-relevant changes:
 - GUI
  - Selected structures are now in a separate class
  - Additional structures are now displayed using the same "API"
 - Simulation
  - removed the MSNet::dictionary
  - refactored the MSMeanData-output

Changes from 0.8.0 to 0.8.0.1
Mostly functioning and stable. The main changes are:
- GUI
 - The gui now remembers the last used folder
 - The gui now remembers his
 - The instance chooser was reworked and shows now which items are selected
 - An selected-items dialog with the ability to save the names of the selected items was implemented
 - New colours for aggregated view (aggregated views are still a prototype)
 - Fixed a bug at optional texture disabling
 - Update of trackers and tables on simulation steps added
 - About-dialog debugged
 - Message window scrolls if new text is appended
- Router
 - Output holding the number of loaded, build, and discarded routes added
 - --move-on-short function implemented
 - Bug on repeatedly emitted vehicles patched
- Simulation
 - Bug on repeatedly emitted vehicles patched
- Netconvert
 - Made the geometry of junctions pretty again
 - Too conservative right-of-way rules on importing vissim-networks was reworked
 - general implementation issues
 - Replaced most output to cerr by MsgHandler-calls
- Documentation
 - extended the detector-documentation (user)
 - extended the gui-documentation
 - extended the description of the build process
 - added missing pictures
 - resized some pictures
 - improved the visibility of XML-format descriptions
... and some other things ...

Changes from pre0.8.3 to 0.8.0
Mainly the try to make a working release... Furthermore:
- More detectors
- Aggregated views
- Porting to FOX

Changes from pre0.8.2 to pre0.8.3
Mostly functioning and stable. The changes
- Linux-building patched
- Added a preliminary visualisation of junctions and detectors
- The detectors were reimplemented
- Vehicles and vehicle types now contain a certain color (not yet chooseable)
- Traffic lights may now have offsets
- Different other, smaller things
- Changes from pre0.8 to pre0.8.2
- I decided to post the next pre-release that fast as a bug within the netconversion module strongly disallowed the usage of the package.
- As the network generator is not working yet, but still is included within the package, a further release will be out win the next days.
- Netconversion bug removed
- Preliminary junction display
- Preliminary netgenerator

Changes from 0.7.1 to pre0.8
- Further applications added: router, od2trips-converter, tagreader
- A graphical user interface
- Further import possibilities added: ArcView, Visum, Vissim (partly in work), ARTEMIS
- A new concept of the microsimulation
- Traffic lights simulation
- Working lane changing
