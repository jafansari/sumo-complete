        <title>moc-files not found</title>

        <para><emphasis>Question: </emphasis>For the GUI project I didn’t find
        files such as &#34;moc_GUIApplicationWindow.cpp&#34; (there are seven
        files beginning with “moc_” ). If I delete them, I have some link
        errors like : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol
        &#34;protected: virtual void __thiscall
        GUIApplicationWindow::initMetaObject(void)&#34;
        (?initMetaObject@GUIApplicationWindow@@MAEXXZ)</para>

        <para>Do you have any suggestions to resolve this problem ? </para>

        <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> Yes, those files are used by the
        Qt-library (www.troll-tech.com) and are build automatically. If you
        take a look into the project settings (MSVC++:
        project-&#62;settings-&#62;gui) and open the file browser within this
        window, some .h-files have another icon. If you click on one of these
        and choose the &#34;user defined building&#34; (I do not exactly know
        how it is called in english), you will see some additional program
        calls.</para>

        <para>To build the gui, you have to install Qt2.3 which includes some
        additional programs within a bin-folder, automatically installed. Set
        the environment variable &#34;QTDIR&#34; to the folder you have
        installed Qt into (not to the bin-folder as you may see from the calls
        within the project). This should let MSVC++ build the moc*-files
        first. </para>
