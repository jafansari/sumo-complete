      <title>What is SUMO?</title>

      <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> SUMO is a traffic simulation package.
      It is meant to be used to simulate networks of a city's size, but you
      can of course use it for smaller networks and larger, too, if your
      computer power is large enough.</para>

    <sect2 id="sumo_qa-general-what_means">
      <title>What does "SUMO" mean?</title>

      <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> "SUMO" is an acronym for "Simulation
      of Urban MObility".</para>

    <sect2 id="sumo_qa-general-what_kind">
      <title>What kind of a traffic simulation is SUMO?</title>

      <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> SUMO is a microscopic,
      space-continuous road traffic simulation. In the next time it will be
      extended to be multi-modal.</para>

        <title>How do I access the CVS using cygwin or Linux?</title>

        <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> For the initial checkout use the
        following command:</para>

        <screen>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@sumo.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sumo co -P sumo</screen>

        <para>Press <keycode>RETURN</keycode> if you should be asked for a
        password.</para>

        <para>For later updates go inside the sumo directory, which has been
        created, and simply type cvs up -dPA.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Question:</emphasis> When i send the make command, i
        get back many errors, all look like the following:<screen>./utils/glutils/libglutils.a(GLHelper.o): In function
`GLHelper::drawOutlineCircle(float, float, int, float, float)':
/home/smartie/sumo-0.9.5/src/utils/glutils/GLHelper.cpp:352:
undefined reference to `glEnd'
</screen></para>

        <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> SUMO needs FOX-toolkit to be build
        with openGL-support enabled. Do this by compiling FOX-toolkit as
        following:</para>

        <screen>tar xzf fox-1.4.34.tar.gz
cd fox-1.4.34
./configure --with-opengl=yes --prefix=$HOME &amp;&amp; make install

      <para><emphasis>Question: </emphasis>Is it possible to connect SUMO to
      an external application (f.e. ns-2)?</para>

      <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> No, not yet. We have build an
      internal version which handles connections to other applications, but
      it's not yet available as open source. So in principle, it is possible,
      but there is nothing that does it within the current code.</para>

        Error: Quitting (conversion failed).</para>

        <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> Simply that the file you try to use
        (&lt;PATH&gt;) does not exist. This is xerces' way to say "file not
        found".</para>

        <title>The application hangs after a while (few memory consumption,
        most of the system time)</title>

        <para><emphasis>Question: </emphasis>When I start the SUMO-NETCONVERT
        with large networks, the system hangs after a while. The program uses
        most of the system time, but when I look into the task manager almost
        no memory is used.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> You are propably running a program
        compiled in the debug-mode. This yields in at least the triple of
        normal memory usage and your system may not be able to solve. Try to
        use the normal version, build in Release-mode (or buy more RAM :-)

        <para><emphasis>Question: </emphasis>I have tried to insert vehicles
        using the -R option, but the route file is empty.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> On the one hand, SUMO-routers quit
        processing if a route could not be build. On the other hand, the
        generation of a random route may fail quite easily, simply because
        it's too short or no connection could have been found. If you have
        made everything right, but your route file is empty, try to use the
        --continue-on-unbuild switch on your command line / within your
        configuration file.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Question: </emphasis>I have changed my network and now
        SUMO does not load it.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> Actually, SUMO-networks are not
        meant to be edited by hand. You have to describe everything within the
        your input properly and let NETVCONVERT build your network. Editing
        networks by hand is very complicated and error-proned.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Question: </emphasis>I have build the network and
        routes like described, but no vehicle can be seen)</para>

        <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> We encountered this problem under
        the following circumstances: As we imported a network where the
        maximum speed allowed on was given in km/h instead of the supposed
        m/s, no vehicle could be emitted due to a too large space needed for
        oncoming traffic. Check whether your network description also defines
        speed in km/h. If so, use the SUMO-NETCONVERT - switch "speed-in-kmh"
        to recompute the speed limits. If this does not help, contact
        us.</para>

        <title>Vehicle jumps backward</title>

        <para><emphasis>Question: </emphasis>When I try to evaluate my vehicle
        dump, sometimes vehicle seem to jump backward (their position is
        smaller than in the previous step)</para>

        <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> To avoid jams due to an
        inappropriate lane changing behaviour, vehicles may swap their lanes.
        In this case each vehicle obtains the position and speed of the other
        vehicle. As the position of the vehicles may differ a bit, one of the
        vehicles may seem to jump backwards.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Remark:</emphasis> This should not happen from
        Version0.8 on.</para>

    <sect2 id="sumo_qa-usage-simulation-tls-changing_duration">
      <title>Changing the duration of Cycles and Phases</title>

      <para><emphasis>Question:</emphasis> I want to study the effects of
      changing the periods of the traffic light. (time green
      left/straight/right in both directions and the "dead time" = all
      directions have red); how do I change the period of the traffic
      light?</para>

      <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> If you have a network that contains
      traffic lights, you can open it with a text editor. Then search for
      "tl-logic". You will find the definition(s) of your traffic light(s).
      Now, you can see a set of "phase"-definitions within each of the traffic
      lights definitions. You can change the time for each phase directly in
      here.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Question: </emphasis>Why is the view around the mouse
        pointer distorted?</para>

        <para><emphasis>Answer:</emphasis> Newer Windows-Versions seem to
        cache the area under the mouse to apply the mouse shadow afterwards.
        To avoid this, go to your Systemmenu, then Mouse-&gt;Pointers and
        disable the mouse shadows. That's the only solution so far. (Origin:
