# The following deadlock should be detected and resolved:
# Vehicles wait at triggered stops for riders which never come because all persons have left the simulation or are themselves waiting.
# At the same time persons wait for rides which never come because all vehicles have left the simulation or are themselves waiting for riders.
# Under these conditions all remaining vehicles and persons should abort their trips/plans.

# invalid teleport message in connection with arrivalpos. 
# Note that this behaviour highly nondeterministic:
# The probability that a certain seed shows this behaviour is greatly affected by small changes in geometry
