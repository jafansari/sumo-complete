# This test shows undesireable dynamics:
# A brakes to let B merge but B breaks as well so it does not help

# This test shows undesireable dynamics:
# A brakes to let B merge but A is much to fast for this to be useful

# This test shows undesireable dynamics:
# This is an expanded case of test 'blocker_on_main_brakes2'
# A flow of vehicles on the main road tries to help a vehicle merge from the ramp.
# Everyone brakes only a little but this accumulates into a standstill on the main highway.
