After downloading the sources from cvs call

make -f Makefile.cvs
./configure --with-xerces-libraries=<PATH_TO_XERCES_LIB> --with-xerces-includes=<PATH_TO_XERCES_INCLUDES> --with-fox-libraries=<PATH_TO_FOX_LIB> --with-fox-includes=<PATH_TO_FOX_INCLUDES> --with-gdal-includes=<PATH_TO_GDAL_INCLUDES> --with-gdal-libraries=<PATH_TO_GDAL_LIBRARIES>
make

to build sumo*. Add configure-option when needed (see ./configure --help
for possible options)
