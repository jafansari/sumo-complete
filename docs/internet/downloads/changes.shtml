<b>Changes from pre0.8.3 to 0.8.0</b>
<p>Mainly the try to make a working release... Furthermore:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>More detectors
    <li>Aggregated views
    <li>Porting to FOX
</ul></p>

<hr/>

<b>Changes from pre0.8.2 to pre0.8.3</b>
<p>
Mostly functioning and stable. The changes
</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Linux-building patched
    <li>Added a preliminary visualisation of junctions and detectors
    <li>The detectors were reimplemented
    <li>Vehicles and vehicle types now contain a certain color (not yet chooseable)
    <li>Traffic lights may now have offsets
    <li>Different other, smaller things
</ul></p>

<b>Changes from pre0.8 to pre0.8.2</b>
<p>
I decided to post the next pre-release that fast as a bug within the netconversion module strongly disallowed the usage of the package.<br>
As the network generator is not working yet, but still is included within the package, a further release will be out win the next days.
</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Netconversion bug removed
    <li>Preliminary junction display
    <li>Preliminary netgenerator
</ul></p>

<b>Changes from 0.7.1 to pre0.8</b>
<p><ul>
    <li>Further applications added: router, od2trips-converter, tagreader
    <li>A graphical user interface
    <li>Further import possibilities added: ArcView, Visum, Vissim (partly in work), ARTEMIS
    <li>A new concept of the microsimulation
    <li>Traffic lights simulation
    <li>Working lane changing
</ul></p>
